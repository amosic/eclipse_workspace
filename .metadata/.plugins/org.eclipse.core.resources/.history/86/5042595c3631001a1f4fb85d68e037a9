	//in the opposite case "else" we can take what the user entered and treat as value and return the factoriel. So I should use a "for" cycle, i will start from 1, i will stop at our nr itself, and at every cycle we will add 1 at i)
	//i need a variable which will contain the result, so i will declare my variable at this level and i will call it here  "res". Par default my variable will be 1. Everytime we willl do the cycle we will take what we have at the res level, we multiply by i and we put after at the res level.

/* 
 * Recursivity
 * A method could call itself (un metodo puo chiamare se stesso). In this case we talk about recursivity.
 * To understand this fact we will make a programme called factoriel of numbers.
 * 4!=1*2*3*4= 4*3*2*1
 * 5!= 1*2*3*4*5
 * 0!=1
 * 1!=1
